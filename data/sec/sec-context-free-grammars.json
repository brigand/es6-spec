Each production has an abstract symbol called a\n      <i>nonterminal</i> as its <i>left-hand side</i>, and a sequence of zero or more nonterminal and <i>terminal</i> symbols as\n      its <i>right-hand side</i>. For each grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.</p>\n\n      <p>A <i>chain production</i> is a production that has exactly one nonterminal symbol on its right-hand side along with zero\n      or more terminal symbols.</p>\n\n      <p>Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the <i>goal symbol</i>, a given\n      context-free grammar specifies a <i>language</i>, namely, the (perhaps infinite) set of possible sequences of terminal\n      symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for\n      which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.</p>\n    "}
