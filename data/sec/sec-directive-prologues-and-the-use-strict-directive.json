Implementations may define implementation specific\n        meanings for <span class=\"nt\">ExpressionStatement</span> productions which are not a Use Strict Directive and which occur\n        in a Directive Prologue. If an appropriate notification mechanism exists, an implementation should issue a warning if it\n        encounters in a Directive Prologue an <span class=\"nt\">ExpressionStatement</span> that is not a Use Strict Directive and\n        which does not have a meaning defined by the implementation.</p>\n      </div>\n    "}
