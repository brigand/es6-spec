(Note that the <b>NaN</b> value is produced by the program expression\n      <code>NaN</code>.) In some implementations, external code might be able to detect a difference between various Not-a-Number\n      values, but such behaviour is implementation-dependent; to ECMAScript code, all NaN values are indistinguishable from each\n      other.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"note\">\n        <p><span class=\"nh\">NOTE</span> The bit pattern that might be observed in an ArrayBuffer (<a href=\"/sec/sec-arraybuffer-objects.html\">see 24.1</a>) after a Number value has been stored into it is not necessarily the same as\n        the internal representation of that Number value used by the ECMAScript implementation.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>There are two other special values, called <b>positive Infinity</b> and <b>negative Infinity</b>. For brevity, these\n      values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols <span class=\"value\">+&#x221E;</span> and <span class=\"value\">&#x2212;&#x221E;</span>, respectively.

Half of these are\n      positive numbers and half are negative numbers; for every finite positive Number value there is a corresponding negative\n      value having the same magnitude.</p>\n\n      <p>Note that there is both a <b>positive zero</b> and a <b>negative zero</b>. For brevity, these values are also referred to\n      for expository purposes by the symbols <span class=\"value\">+0</span> and <span class=\"value\">&#x2212;0</span>, respectively.\n      (Note that these two different zero Number values are produced by the program expressions <code>+0</code> (or simply\n      <code>0</code>) and <code>-0</code>.)</p>\n\n      <p>The <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">18437736874454810622</span> (that is, <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">2<sup>64</sup>&#x2212;2<sup>53</sup>&#x2212;2</span>) finite nonzero values are of two kinds:</p>\n\n      <p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">18428729675200069632</span> (that is, <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">2<sup>64</sup>&#x2212;2<sup>54</sup></span>) of them are normalized, having the form</p>\n\n      <div class=\"math-display\"><i>s</i> &#xD7; <i>m</i> &#xD7; 2<sup><i>e</i></sup></div>\n\n      <p>where <var>s</var> is <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">+1</span> or <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">&#x2212;1</span>, <var>m</var> is a positive integer less than <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">2<sup>53</sup></span> but not less than <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">2<sup>52</sup></span>, and\n      <var>e</var> is an integer ranging from <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">&#x2212;1074</span> to <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">971</span>, inclusive.</p>\n\n      <p>The remaining <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">9007199254740990</span> (that is, <span style=\"font-family:\n      Times New Roman\">2<sup>53</sup>&#x2212;2</span>) values are denormalized, having the form</p>\n\n      <div class=\"math-display\"><i>s</i> &#xD7; <i>m</i> &#xD7; 2<sup><i>e</i></sup></div>\n\n      <p>where <var>s</var> is <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">+1</span> or <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">&#x2212;1</span>, <var>m</var> is a positive integer less than <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">2<sup>52</sup></span>, and <var>e</var> is <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">&#x2212;1074</span>.</p>\n\n      <p>Note that all the positive and negative integers whose magnitude is no greater than <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">2<sup>53</sup></span> are representable in the Number type (indeed, the integer <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">0</span> has two representations, <code>+0</code> and <code>-0</code>).</p>\n\n      <p>A finite number has an <i>odd significand</i> if it is nonzero and the integer <var>m</var> used to express it (in one of\n      the two forms shown above) is odd. Otherwise, it has an <i>even significand</i>.</p>\n\n      <p>In this specification, the phrase &#x201C;<span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">the Number value for\n      <i>x</i></span>&#x201D; where <var>x</var> represents an exact nonzero real mathematical quantity (which might even be an\n      irrational number such as <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">&#x3C0;</span>) means a Number value chosen in the\n      following manner. Consider the set of all finite values of the Number type, with <span class=\"value\">&#x2212;0</span> removed\n      and with two additional values added to it that are not representable in the Number type, namely <span style=\"font-family:\n      Times New Roman\">2<sup>1024</sup></span> (which is <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">+1 &#xD7;\n      2<sup>53</sup></span> <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">&#xD7; 2<sup>971</sup></span>) and <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">&#x2212;2<sup>1024</sup></span> (which is <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">&#x2212;1 &#xD7; 2<sup>53</sup></span> <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">&#xD7; 2<sup>971</sup></span>).\n      Choose the member of this set that is closest in value to <var>x</var>. If two values of the set are equally close, then the\n      one with an even significand is chosen; for this purpose, the two extra values <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">2<sup>1024</sup></span> and <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">&#x2212;2<sup>1024</sup></span> are considered\n      to have even significands. Finally, if <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">2<sup>1024</sup></span> was chosen,\n      replace it with <span class=\"value\">+&#x221E;</span>; if <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">&#x2212;2<sup>1024</sup></span> was chosen, replace it with <span class=\"value\">&#x2212;&#x221E;</span>; if <span class=\"value\">+0</span> was chosen, replace it with <span class=\"value\">&#x2212;0</span> if and only if <var>x</var> is less\n      than zero; any other chosen value is used unchanged. The result is the Number value for <var>x</var>. (This procedure\n      corresponds exactly to the behaviour of the IEEE 754-2008 &#x201C;round to nearest, ties to even&#x201D; mode.)</p>\n\n      <p>Some ECMAScript operators deal only with integers in specific ranges such as <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">&#x2212;2<sup>31</sup></span> through <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">2<sup>31</sup>&#x2212;1</span>,\n      inclusive, or in the range <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">0</span> through <span style=\"font-family: Times New\n      Roman\">2<sup>16</sup>&#x2212;1</span>, inclusive. These operators accept any value of the Number type but first convert each\n      such value to an integer value in the expected range.
