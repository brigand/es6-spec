However, a labelled <span class=\"nt\">FunctionDeclaration</span> was an allowable extension for non-<a href=\"/sec/sec-strict-mode-code.html\">strict code</a> and\n      most browser-hosted ECMAScript implementations supported that extension. In ECMAScript 2015, the grammar productions for\n      <span class=\"nt\">LabelledStatement</span> permits use of <span class=\"nt\">FunctionDeclaration</span> as a <span class=\"nt\">LabelledItem</span> but <a href=\"/sec/sec-labelled-statements-static-semantics-early-errors.html\">13.13.1</a> includes an\n      Early Error rule that produces a Syntax Error if that occurs. For web browser compatibility, that rule is modified with the\n      addition of the underlined text:</p>\n\n      <div class=\"gp prod\"><span class=\"nt\">LabelledItem</span> <span class=\"geq\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">FunctionDeclaration</span></div>\n      <ul>\n        <li>It is a Syntax Error if any strict mode source code matches this rule.</li>\n      </ul>\n    "}
