Array instances\n        inherit properties from the Array prototype object.</p>\n\n        <p>Array instances have a <code>length</code> property, and a set of enumerable properties with array index names.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <section id=\"sec-properties-of-array-instances-length\">\n        <h1><span class=\"secnum\" id=\"sec-22.1.4.1\"><a href=\"/sec/sec-properties-of-array-instances-length.html\" title=\"link to this section\">22.1.4.1</a></span> length</h1>\n\n        <p>The <code>length</code> property of an Array instance is a data property whose value is always numerically greater than\n        the name of every configurable own property whose name is an array index.</p>\n\n        <p>The <code>length</code> property initially has the attributes <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">{\n        [[Writable]]: <b>true</b>, [[Enumerable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Configurable]]: <b>false</b> }</span>.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"note\">\n          <p><span class=\"nh\">NOTE</span> Reducing the value of the <code>length</code> property has the side-effect of deleting\n          own array elements whose array index is between the old and new length values. However, non-configurable properties can\n          not be deleted. Attempting to set the length property of an Array object to a value that is numerically less than or\n          equal to the largest numeric own property name of an existing non-configurable array indexed property of the array will\n          result in the length being set to a numeric value that is one greater than that non-configurable numeric own property\n          name.
