If an ECMAScript implementation does not\n        include the ECMA-402 API the following  specification of the <code>localeCompare</code> method is used.</p>\n\n        <p>When the <code>localeCompare</code> method is called with argument <var>that</var>, it returns a Number other than\n        <b>NaN</b> that represents the result of a locale-sensitive String comparison of the <b>this</b> value (converted to a\n        String) with <var>that</var> (converted to a String). The two Strings are <var>S</var> and <span class=\"nt\">That</span>.\n        The two Strings are compared in an implementation-defined fashion. The result is intended to order String values in the\n        sort order specified by a host default locale, and will be negative, zero, or positive, depending on whether <var>S</var>\n        comes before <span class=\"nt\">That</span> in the sort order, the Strings are equal, or <var>S</var> comes after <span class=\"nt\">That</span> in the sort order, respectively.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"normalbefore\">Before performing the comparisons, the following steps are performed to prepare the Strings:</p>\n\n        <ol class=\"proc\">\n          <li>Let <i>O</i> be <a href=\"/sec/sec-requireobjectcoercible.html\">RequireObjectCoercible</a>(<b>this</b> value).</li>\n          <li>Let <i>S</i> be <a href=\"/sec/sec-tostring.html\">ToString</a>(<i>O</i>).</li>\n          <li><a href=\"/sec/sec-returnifabrupt.html\">ReturnIfAbrupt</a>(<i>S</i>).</li>\n          <li>Let <i>That</i> be <a href=\"/sec/sec-tostring.html\">ToString</a>(<i>that</i>).</li>\n          <li><a href=\"/sec/sec-returnifabrupt.html\">ReturnIfAbrupt</a>(<i>That</i>).</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>The meaning of the optional second and third parameters to this method are defined in the ECMA-402 specification;\n        implementations that do not include ECMA-402 support must not assign any other interpretation to those parameter\n        positions.</p>\n\n        <p>The <code>localeCompare</code> method, if considered as a function of two arguments <b>this</b> and <var>that</var>, is\n        a consistent comparison function (as defined in <a href=\"/sec/sec-array.prototype.sort.html\">22.1.3.24</a>) on the set of all\n        Strings.</p>\n\n        <p>The actual return values are implementation-defined to permit implementers to encode additional information in the\n        value, but the function is required to define a total ordering on all Strings. This function must treat Strings that are\n        canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical and must return <code>0</code> when comparing\n        Strings that are considered canonically equivalent.</p>\n\n        <p>The <code>length</code> property of the <code>localeCompare</code> method is <b>1</b>.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"note\">\n          <p><span class=\"nh\">NOTE 1</span> The <code>localeCompare</code> method itself is not directly suitable as an argument\n          to <code><a href=\"/sec/sec-array.prototype.sort.html\">Array.prototype.sort</a></code> because the latter requires a function of\n          two arguments.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"note\">\n          <p><span class=\"nh\">NOTE 2</span> This function is intended to rely on whatever language-sensitive comparison\n          functionality is available to the ECMAScript environment from the host environment, and to compare according to the\n          rules of the host environment&#x2019;s current locale. However, regardless of the host provided comparison capabilities,\n          this function must treat Strings that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical. It is\n          recommended that this function should not honour Unicode compatibility equivalences or decompositions. For a definition\n          and discussion of canonical equivalence see the Unicode Standard, chapters 2 and 3, as well as Unicode Standard Annex\n          #15, Unicode Normalization Forms (<a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/\">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/</a>) and Unicode Technical Note #5,\n          Canonical Equivalence in Applications (<a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn5/\">http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn5/</a>).
