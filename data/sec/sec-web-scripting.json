Further, the\n    host environment provides a means to attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page and image loading,\n    unloading, error and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. Scripting code appears within the HTML and the\n    displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and fixed and computed text and images. The scripting code is\n    reactive to user interaction and there is no need for a main program.</p>\n\n    <p>A web server provides a different host environment for server-side computation including objects representing requests,\n    clients, and files; and mechanisms to lock and share data. By using browser-side and server-side scripting together, it is\n    possible to distribute computation between the client and server while providing a customized user interface for a Web-based\n    application.</p>\n\n    <p>Each Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own host environment, completing the ECMAScript execution\n    environment.</p>\n  "}
