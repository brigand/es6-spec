        <h1><span class="secnum" id="sec-12.6.3.2"><a href="/sec/sec-applying-the-div-operator.html" title="link to this section">12.6.3.2</a></span> Applying the <code>/</code> Operator</h1>

        <p>The <code>/</code> <span class="nt">MultiplicativeOperator</span> performs division, producing the quotient of its
        operands. The left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor. ECMAScript does not perform integer
        division. The operands and result of all division operations are double-precision floating-point numbers. The result of
        division is determined by the specification of IEEE 754-2008 arithmetic:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The sign of the result is positive if both operands have the same sign, negative if the operands have different
            signs.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of an infinity by an infinity results in <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of an infinity by a zero results in an infinity. The sign is determined by the rule already stated
            above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of an infinity by a nonzero finite value results in a signed infinity. The sign is determined by the rule
            already stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of a finite value by an infinity results in zero. The sign is determined by the rule already stated
            above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of a zero by a zero results in <b>NaN</b>; division of zero by any other finite value results in zero,
            with the sign determined by the rule already stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of a nonzero finite value by a zero results in a signed infinity. The sign is determined by the rule
            already stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor <b>NaN</b> is involved, the quotient is computed
            and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754-2008 round-to-nearest mode. If the magnitude is too
            large to represent, the operation overflows; the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is
            too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of the appropriate sign. The ECMAScript
            language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by IEEE 754-2008.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
