        <h1><span class="secnum" id="sec-12.6.3.3"><a href="/sec/sec-applying-the-mod-operator.html" title="link to this section">12.6.3.3</a></span> Applying the <code>%</code> Operator</h1>

        <p>The <code>%</code> <span class="nt">MultiplicativeOperator</span> yields the remainder of its operands from an implied
        division; the left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p><span class="nh">NOTE</span> In C and C++, the remainder operator accepts only integral operands; in ECMAScript, it
          also accepts floating-point operands.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The result of a floating-point remainder operation as computed by the <code>%</code> operator is not the same as the
        &#x201C;remainder&#x201D; operation defined by IEEE 754-2008. The IEEE 754-2008 &#x201C;remainder&#x201D; operation computes
        the remainder from a rounding division, not a truncating division, and so its behaviour is not analogous to that of the
        usual integer remainder operator. Instead the ECMAScript language defines <code>%</code> on floating-point operations to
        behave in a manner analogous to that of the Java integer remainder operator; this may be compared with the C library
        function fmod.</p>

        <p>The result of an ECMAScript floating-point remainder operation is determined by the rules of IEEE arithmetic:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The sign of the result equals the sign of the dividend.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the dividend is an infinity, or the divisor is a zero, or both, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the dividend is finite and the divisor is an infinity, the result equals the dividend.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the dividend is a zero and the divisor is nonzero and finite, the result is the same as the dividend.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor <b>NaN</b> is involved, the floating-point
            remainder r from a dividend n and a divisor d is defined by the mathematical relation r = n &#x2212; (d &#xD7; q)
            where q is an integer that is negative only if n/d is negative and positive only if n/d is positive, and whose
            magnitude is as large as possible without exceeding the magnitude of the true mathematical quotient of n and d. r is
            computed and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754-2008 round-to-nearest mode.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
