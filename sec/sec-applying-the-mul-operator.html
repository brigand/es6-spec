        <p>The <code>*</code> <span class="nt">MultiplicativeOperator</span> performs multiplication, producing the product of its
        operands. Multiplication is commutative. Multiplication is not always associative in ECMAScript, because of finite
        precision.</p>

        <p>The result of a floating-point multiplication is governed by the rules of IEEE 754-2008 binary double-precision
        arithmetic:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The sign of the result is positive if both operands have the same sign, negative if the operands have different
            signs.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Multiplication of an infinity by a zero results in <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Multiplication of an infinity by an infinity results in an infinity. The sign is determined by the rule already
            stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Multiplication of an infinity by a finite nonzero value results in a signed infinity. The sign is determined by the
            rule already stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity nor <b>NaN</b> is involved, the product is computed and rounded
            to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754-2008 round-to-nearest mode. If the magnitude is too large to
            represent, the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the result
            is then a zero of appropriate sign. The ECMAScript language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by IEEE
            754-2008.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
