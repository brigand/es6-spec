          Context-Free Grammars</h1>

      <p>A <i>context-free grammar</i> consists of a number of <i>productions</i>. Each production has an abstract symbol called a
      <i>nonterminal</i> as its <i>left-hand side</i>, and a sequence of zero or more nonterminal and <i>terminal</i> symbols as
      its <i>right-hand side</i>. For each grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.</p>

      <p>A <i>chain production</i> is a production that has exactly one nonterminal symbol on its right-hand side along with zero
      or more terminal symbols.</p>

      <p>Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the <i>goal symbol</i>, a given
      context-free grammar specifies a <i>language</i>, namely, the (perhaps infinite) set of possible sequences of terminal
      symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for
      which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.</p>
