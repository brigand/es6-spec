      <p>A Directive Prologue is the longest sequence of <span class="nt">ExpressionStatement</span> productions occurring as the
      initial <span class="nt">StatementListItem</span> or <span class="nt">ModuleItem</span> productions of a <span class="nt">FunctionBody</span>, a <span class="nt">ScriptBody</span>, or a <span class="nt">ModuleBody</span> and where each
      <span class="nt">ExpressionStatement</span> in the sequence consists entirely of a <span class="nt">StringLiteral</span>
      token followed by a semicolon<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">.</span> The semicolon may appear explicitly or may
      be inserted by <a href="/sec/sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion.html">automatic semicolon insertion</a>. A Directive Prologue may be
      an empty sequence.</p>

      <p>A Use Strict Directive is an <span class="nt">ExpressionStatement</span> in a Directive Prologue whose <span class="nt">StringLiteral</span> is either the exact code unit sequences <code>&quot;use</code>&#xA0;<code>strict&quot;</code> or
      <code>&apos;use</code>&#xA0;<code>strict&apos;</code>. A Use Strict Directive may not contain an <span class="nt">EscapeSequence</span> or <span class="nt">LineContinuation</span>.</p>

      <p>A Directive Prologue may contain more than one Use Strict Directive. However, an implementation may issue a warning if
      this occurs.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p><span class="nh">NOTE</span> The <span class="nt">ExpressionStatement</span> productions of a Directive Prologue are
        evaluated normally during evaluation of the containing production. Implementations may define implementation specific
        meanings for <span class="nt">ExpressionStatement</span> productions which are not a Use Strict Directive and which occur
        in a Directive Prologue. If an appropriate notification mechanism exists, an implementation should issue a warning if it
        encounters in a Directive Prologue an <span class="nt">ExpressionStatement</span> that is not a Use Strict Directive and
        which does not have a meaning defined by the implementation.</p>
