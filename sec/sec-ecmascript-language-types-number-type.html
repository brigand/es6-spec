      <h1><span class="secnum" id="sec-6.1.6"><a href="/sec/sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type.html" title="link to this section">6.1.6</a></span> The Number Type</h1>

      <p>The Number type has exactly <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">18437736874454810627</span> (that is, <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">2<sup>64</sup>&#x2212;2<sup>53</sup>+3</span>) values, representing the double-precision
      64-bit format IEEE 754-2008 values as specified in the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, except that the
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">9007199254740990</span> (that is, <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">2<sup>53</sup>&#x2212;2</span>) distinct &#x201C;Not-a-Number&#x201D; values of the IEEE Standard are represented in
      ECMAScript as a single special <b>NaN</b> value. (Note that the <b>NaN</b> value is produced by the program expression
      <code>NaN</code>.) In some implementations, external code might be able to detect a difference between various Not-a-Number
      values, but such behaviour is implementation-dependent; to ECMAScript code, all NaN values are indistinguishable from each
      other.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p><span class="nh">NOTE</span> The bit pattern that might be observed in an ArrayBuffer (<a href="/sec/sec-arraybuffer-objects.html">see 24.1</a>) after a Number value has been stored into it is not necessarily the same as
        the internal representation of that Number value used by the ECMAScript implementation.</p>
      </div>

      <p>There are two other special values, called <b>positive Infinity</b> and <b>negative Infinity</b>. For brevity, these
      values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols <span class="value">+&#x221E;</span> and <span class="value">&#x2212;&#x221E;</span>, respectively. (Note that these two infinite Number values are produced by the program
      expressions <code>+Infinity</code> (or simply <code>Infinity</code>) and <code>-Infinity</code>.)</p>

      <p>The other <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">18437736874454810624</span> (that is, <span style="font-family:
      Times New Roman">2<sup>64</sup>&#x2212;2<sup>53</sup></span>) values are called the finite numbers. Half of these are
      positive numbers and half are negative numbers; for every finite positive Number value there is a corresponding negative
      value having the same magnitude.</p>

      <p>Note that there is both a <b>positive zero</b> and a <b>negative zero</b>. For brevity, these values are also referred to
      for expository purposes by the symbols <span class="value">+0</span> and <span class="value">&#x2212;0</span>, respectively.
      (Note that these two different zero Number values are produced by the program expressions <code>+0</code> (or simply
      <code>0</code>) and <code>-0</code>.)</p>

      <p>The <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">18437736874454810622</span> (that is, <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">2<sup>64</sup>&#x2212;2<sup>53</sup>&#x2212;2</span>) finite nonzero values are of two kinds:</p>

      <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">18428729675200069632</span> (that is, <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">2<sup>64</sup>&#x2212;2<sup>54</sup></span>) of them are normalized, having the form</p>

      <div class="math-display"><i>s</i> &#xD7; <i>m</i> &#xD7; 2<sup><i>e</i></sup></div>

      <p>where <var>s</var> is <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">+1</span> or <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">&#x2212;1</span>, <var>m</var> is a positive integer less than <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">2<sup>53</sup></span> but not less than <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">2<sup>52</sup></span>, and
      <var>e</var> is an integer ranging from <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&#x2212;1074</span> to <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">971</span>, inclusive.</p>

      <p>The remaining <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">9007199254740990</span> (that is, <span style="font-family:
      Times New Roman">2<sup>53</sup>&#x2212;2</span>) values are denormalized, having the form</p>

      <div class="math-display"><i>s</i> &#xD7; <i>m</i> &#xD7; 2<sup><i>e</i></sup></div>

      <p>where <var>s</var> is <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">+1</span> or <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">&#x2212;1</span>, <var>m</var> is a positive integer less than <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">2<sup>52</sup></span>, and <var>e</var> is <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&#x2212;1074</span>.</p>

      <p>Note that all the positive and negative integers whose magnitude is no greater than <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">2<sup>53</sup></span> are representable in the Number type (indeed, the integer <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">0</span> has two representations, <code>+0</code> and <code>-0</code>).</p>

      <p>A finite number has an <i>odd significand</i> if it is nonzero and the integer <var>m</var> used to express it (in one of
      the two forms shown above) is odd. Otherwise, it has an <i>even significand</i>.</p>

      <p>In this specification, the phrase &#x201C;<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">the Number value for
      <i>x</i></span>&#x201D; where <var>x</var> represents an exact nonzero real mathematical quantity (which might even be an
      irrational number such as <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&#x3C0;</span>) means a Number value chosen in the
      following manner. Consider the set of all finite values of the Number type, with <span class="value">&#x2212;0</span> removed
      and with two additional values added to it that are not representable in the Number type, namely <span style="font-family:
      Times New Roman">2<sup>1024</sup></span> (which is <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">+1 &#xD7;
      2<sup>53</sup></span> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&#xD7; 2<sup>971</sup></span>) and <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&#x2212;2<sup>1024</sup></span> (which is <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">&#x2212;1 &#xD7; 2<sup>53</sup></span> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&#xD7; 2<sup>971</sup></span>).
      Choose the member of this set that is closest in value to <var>x</var>. If two values of the set are equally close, then the
      one with an even significand is chosen; for this purpose, the two extra values <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">2<sup>1024</sup></span> and <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&#x2212;2<sup>1024</sup></span> are considered
      to have even significands. Finally, if <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">2<sup>1024</sup></span> was chosen,
      replace it with <span class="value">+&#x221E;</span>; if <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">&#x2212;2<sup>1024</sup></span> was chosen, replace it with <span class="value">&#x2212;&#x221E;</span>; if <span class="value">+0</span> was chosen, replace it with <span class="value">&#x2212;0</span> if and only if <var>x</var> is less
      than zero; any other chosen value is used unchanged. The result is the Number value for <var>x</var>. (This procedure
      corresponds exactly to the behaviour of the IEEE 754-2008 &#x201C;round to nearest, ties to even&#x201D; mode.)</p>

      <p>Some ECMAScript operators deal only with integers in specific ranges such as <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">&#x2212;2<sup>31</sup></span> through <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">2<sup>31</sup>&#x2212;1</span>,
      inclusive, or in the range <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0</span> through <span style="font-family: Times New
      Roman">2<sup>16</sup>&#x2212;1</span>, inclusive. These operators accept any value of the Number type but first convert each
      such value to an integer value in the expected range. See the descriptions of the numeric conversion operations in <a href="/sec/sec-type-conversion.html">7.1</a>.</p>
