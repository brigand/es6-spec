      <h1><span class="secnum" id="sec-6.1.4"><a href="/sec/sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type.html" title="link to this section">6.1.4</a></span> The String Type</h1>

      <p>The String type is the set of all ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer values
      (&#x201C;elements&#x201D;) up to a maximum length of 2<sup>53</sup>-1 elements. The String type is generally used to represent
      textual data in a running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the String is treated as a UTF-16 code unit
      value. Each element is regarded as occupying a position within the sequence. These positions are indexed with nonnegative
      integers. The first element (if any) is at index 0, the next element (if any) at index 1, and so on. The length of a String
      is the number of elements (i.e., 16-bit values) within it. The empty String has length zero and therefore contains no
      elements.</p>

      <p>Where ECMAScript operations interpret String values, each element is interpreted as a single UTF-16 code unit. However,
      ECMAScript does not place any restrictions or requirements on the sequence of code units in a String value, so they may be
      ill-formed when interpreted as UTF-16 code unit sequences. Operations that do not interpret String contents treat them as
      sequences of undifferentiated 16-bit unsigned integers. The function <code><a href="/sec/sec-string.prototype.normalize.html">String.prototype.normalize</a></code> (<a href="/sec/sec-string.prototype.normalize.html">see
      21.1.3.12</a>) can be used to explicitly normalize a String value. <code><a href="/sec/sec-string.prototype.localecompare.html">String.prototype.localeCompare</a></code> (<a href="/sec/sec-string.prototype.localecompare.html">see 21.1.3.10</a>) internally normalizes String values, but no other operations
      implicitly normalize the strings upon which they operate. Only operations that are explicitly specified to be language or
      locale sensitive produce language-sensitive results.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p><span class="nh">NOTE</span> The rationale behind this design was to keep the implementation of Strings as simple and
        high-performing as possible. If ECMAScript source text is in Normalized Form C, string literals are guaranteed to also be
        normalized, as long as they do not contain any Unicode escape sequences.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Some operations interpret String contents as UTF-16 encoded Unicode code points. In that case the interpretation is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A code unit in the range <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0</span> to <span style="font-family: Times New
          Roman">0xD7FF</span> or in the range <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0xE000</span> to <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0xFFFF</span> is interpreted as a code point with the same value.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A sequence of two code units, where the first code unit <var>c1</var> is in the range <span style="font-family: Times
          New Roman">0xD800</span> to <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0xDBFF</span> and the second code unit
          <var>c2</var> is in the range <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0xDC00</span> to <span style="font-family:
          Times New Roman">0xDFFF</span>, is a surrogate pair and is interpreted as a code point with the value (<var>c1</var> -
          <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0xD800</span>) &#xD7; <span style="font-family: Times New
          Roman">0x400</span> + (<var>c2</var> &#x2013; <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0xDC00</span>) + <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0x10000</span>. (See <a href="/sec/sec-utf16decode.html">10.1.2</a>)</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A code unit that is in the range <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0xD800</span> to <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">0xDFFF</span>, but is not part of a surrogate pair, is interpreted as a code point
          with the same value.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
