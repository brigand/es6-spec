        <p>The <code>*</code> <span class="nt">MultiplicativeOperator</span> performs multiplication, producing the product of its
        operands. Multiplication is commutative. Multiplication is not always associative in ECMAScript, because of finite
        precision.</p>

        <p>The result of a floating-point multiplication is governed by the rules of IEEE 754-2008 binary double-precision
        arithmetic:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The sign of the result is positive if both operands have the same sign, negative if the operands have different
            signs.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Multiplication of an infinity by a zero results in <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Multiplication of an infinity by an infinity results in an infinity. The sign is determined by the rule already
            stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Multiplication of an infinity by a finite nonzero value results in a signed infinity. The sign is determined by the
            rule already stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity nor <b>NaN</b> is involved, the product is computed and rounded
            to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754-2008 round-to-nearest mode. If the magnitude is too large to
            represent, the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the result
            is then a zero of appropriate sign. The ECMAScript language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by IEEE
            754-2008.</p>

        <p>The <code>/</code> <span class="nt">MultiplicativeOperator</span> performs division, producing the quotient of its
        operands. The left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor. ECMAScript does not perform integer
        division. The operands and result of all division operations are double-precision floating-point numbers. The result of
        division is determined by the specification of IEEE 754-2008 arithmetic:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>

            <p>Division of an infinity by a zero results in an infinity. The sign is determined by the rule already stated
            above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of an infinity by a nonzero finite value results in a signed infinity. The sign is determined by the rule
            already stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of a finite value by an infinity results in zero. The sign is determined by the rule already stated
            above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of a zero by a zero results in <b>NaN</b>; division of zero by any other finite value results in zero,
            with the sign determined by the rule already stated above.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Division of a nonzero finite value by a zero results in a signed infinity. The sign is determined by the rule
            already stated above.</p>

          <li>
            <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor <b>NaN</b> is involved, the quotient is computed
            and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754-2008 round-to-nearest mode. If the magnitude is too
            large to represent, the operation overflows; the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is
            too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of the appropriate sign. The ECMAScript
            language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by IEEE 754-2008.</p>

        <h1><span class="secnum" id="sec-12.6.3.3"><a href="/sec/sec-applying-the-mod-operator.html" title="link to this section">12.6.3.3</a></span> Applying the <code>%</code> Operator</h1>

        <p>The <code>%</code> <span class="nt">MultiplicativeOperator</span> yields the remainder of its operands from an implied
        division; the left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p><span class="nh">NOTE</span> In C and C++, the remainder operator accepts only integral operands; in ECMAScript, it
          also accepts floating-point operands.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The result of a floating-point remainder operation as computed by the <code>%</code> operator is not the same as the
        &#x201C;remainder&#x201D; operation defined by IEEE 754-2008. The IEEE 754-2008 &#x201C;remainder&#x201D; operation computes
        the remainder from a rounding division, not a truncating division, and so its behaviour is not analogous to that of the
        usual integer remainder operator. Instead the ECMAScript language defines <code>%</code> on floating-point operations to
        behave in a manner analogous to that of the Java integer remainder operator; this may be compared with the C library
        function fmod.</p>

        <p>The result of an ECMAScript floating-point remainder operation is determined by the rules of IEEE arithmetic:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The sign of the result equals the sign of the dividend.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the dividend is an infinity, or the divisor is a zero, or both, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the dividend is finite and the divisor is an infinity, the result equals the dividend.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the dividend is a zero and the divisor is nonzero and finite, the result is the same as the dividend.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor <b>NaN</b> is involved, the floating-point
            remainder r from a dividend n and a divisor d is defined by the mathematical relation r = n &#x2212; (d &#xD7; q)
            where q is an integer that is negative only if n/d is negative and positive only if n/d is positive, and whose
            magnitude is as large as possible without exceeding the magnitude of the true mathematical quotient of n and d. r is
            computed and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754-2008 round-to-nearest mode.</p>
