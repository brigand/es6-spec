        <p>The actual semantics of objects, in ECMAScript, are specified via algorithms called <i>internal methods</i>. Each
        object in an ECMAScript engine is associated with a set of internal methods that defines its runtime behaviour. These
        internal methods are not part of the ECMAScript language. They are defined by this specification purely for expository
        purposes. However, each object within an implementation of ECMAScript must behave as specified by the internal methods
        associated with it. The exact manner in which this is accomplished is determined by the implementation.</p>

        <p>Internal method names are polymorphic. This means that different object values may perform different algorithms when a
        common internal method name is invoked upon them. That actual object upon which an internal method is invoked is the
        &#x201C;target&#x201D; of the invocation. If, at runtime, the implementation of an algorithm attempts to use an internal
        method of an object that the object does not support, a <b>TypeError</b> exception is thrown.</p>

        <p>Internal slots correspond to internal state that is associated with objects and used by various ECMAScript
        specification algorithms. Internal slots are not object properties and they are not inherited. Depending upon the specific
        internal slot specification, such state may consist of values of any <a href="/sec/sec-ecmascript-language-types.html">ECMAScript
        language type</a> or of specific ECMAScript specification type values. Unless explicitly specified otherwise, internal
        slots are allocated as part of the process of creating an object and may not be dynamically added to an object. Unless
        specified otherwise, the initial value of an internal slot is the value <span class="value">undefined</span>. Various
        algorithms within this specification create objects that have internal slots. However, the ECMAScript language provides no
        direct way to associate internal slots with an object.</p>

        <p>Internal methods and internal slots are identified within this specification using names enclosed in double square
        brackets [[ ]].</p>

        <p><a href="/sec/table-5.html">Table 5</a> summarizes the <i>essential internal methods</i> used by this specification that are
        applicable to all objects created or manipulated by ECMAScript code. Every object must have algorithms for all of the
        essential internal methods. However, all objects do not necessarily use the same algorithms for those methods.</p>

        <p>The &#x201C;Signature&#x201D; column of <a href="/sec/table-5.html">Table 5</a> and other similar tables describes the invocation
        pattern for each internal method. The invocation pattern always includes a parenthesized list of descriptive parameter
        names. If a parameter name is the same as an ECMAScript type name then the name describes the required type of the
        parameter value. If an internal method  explicitly returns a value, its parameter list is followed by the symbol
        &#x201C;&#x2192;&#x201D; and the type name of the returned value. The type names used in signatures refer to the types defined
        in <a href="/sec/sec-ecmascript-data-types-and-values.html">clause 6</a> augmented by the following additional names.
        &#x201C;<i>any</i>&#x201D; means the value may be any <a href="/sec/sec-ecmascript-language-types.html">ECMAScript language type</a>.
        An internal method implicitly returns a <a href="/sec/sec-completion-record-specification-type.html">Completion Record</a> as
        described in <a href="/sec/sec-completion-record-specification-type.html">6.2.2</a>. In addition to its parameters, an internal
        method always has access to the object that is the target of the method invocation.</p>
