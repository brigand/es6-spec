      <h1><span class="secnum" id="sec-5.1.4"><a href="/sec/sec-syntactic-grammar.html" title="link to this section">5.1.4</a></span> The
          Syntactic Grammar</h1>

      <p>The <i>syntactic grammar</i> for ECMAScript is given in clauses 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This grammar has ECMAScript
      tokens defined by the lexical grammar as its terminal symbols (<a href="/sec/sec-lexical-and-regexp-grammars.html">5.1.2</a>). It
      defines a set of productions, starting from two alternative goal symbols <span class="nt">Script</span> and <span class="nt">Module</span>, that describe how sequences of tokens form syntactically correct independent components of
      ECMAScript programs.</p>

      <p>When a stream of code points is to be parsed as an ECMAScript <span class="nt">Script</span> or <span class="nt">Module</span>, it is first converted to a stream of input elements by repeated application of the lexical
      grammar; this stream of input elements is then parsed by a single application of the syntactic grammar. The input stream is
      syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements cannot be parsed as a single instance of the goal
      nonterminal (<span class="nt">Script</span> or <span class="nt">Module</span>), with no tokens left over.</p>

      <p>Productions of the syntactic grammar are distinguished by having just one colon &#x201C;<b>:</b>&#x201D; as
      punctuation.</p>

      <p>The syntactic grammar as presented in clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15 is not a complete account of which token sequences are
      accepted as a correct ECMAScript <span class="nt">Script</span> or <span class="nt">Module</span>. Certain additional token
      sequences are also accepted, namely, those that would be described by the grammar if only semicolons were added to the
      sequence in certain places (such as before line terminator characters). Furthermore, certain token sequences that are
      described by the grammar are not considered acceptable if a line terminator character appears in certain
      &#x201C;awkward&#x201D; places.</p>

      <p>In certain cases in order to avoid ambiguities the syntactic grammar uses generalized productions that permit token
      sequences that do not form a valid ECMAScript <span class="nt">Script</span> or <span class="nt">Module</span>. For example,
      this technique is used for object literals and object destructuring patterns. In such cases a more restrictive
      <i>supplemental grammar</i> is provided that further restricts the acceptable token sequences. In certain contexts, when
      explicitly specified, the input elements corresponding to such a production are parsed again using a goal symbol of a
      supplemental grammar. The input stream is syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements parsed by a
      cover grammar cannot be parsed as a single instance of the corresponding supplemental goal symbol, with no tokens left
      over.</p>
