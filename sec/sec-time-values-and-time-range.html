        <p>A Date object contains a Number indicating a particular instant in time to within a millisecond. Such a Number is
        called a <i>time value</i>. A time value may also be <b>NaN</b>, indicating that the Date object does not represent a
        specific instant of time.</p>

        <p>Time is measured in ECMAScript in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. In time values leap seconds are ignored. It
        is assumed that there are exactly 86,400,000 milliseconds per day. ECMAScript Number values can represent all integers
        from &#x2013;9,007,199,254,740,992 to 9,007,199,254,740,992; this range suffices to measure times to millisecond precision
        for any instant that is within approximately 285,616 years, either forward or backward, from 01 January, 1970 UTC.</p>

        <p>The actual range of times supported by ECMAScript Date objects is slightly smaller: exactly &#x2013;100,000,000 days to
        100,000,000 days measured relative to midnight at the beginning of 01 January, 1970 UTC. This gives a range of
        8,640,000,000,000,000 milliseconds to either side of 01 January, 1970 UTC.</p>

        <p>The exact moment of midnight at the beginning of 01 January, 1970 UTC is represented by the value <b>+0</b>.</p>
