        Scripting</h1>

    <p>A web browser provides an ECMAScript host environment for client-side computation including, for instance, objects that
    represent windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors, frames, history, cookies, and input/output. Further, the
    host environment provides a means to attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page and image loading,
    unloading, error and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. Scripting code appears within the HTML and the
    displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and fixed and computed text and images. The scripting code is
    reactive to user interaction and there is no need for a main program.</p>

    <p>A web server provides a different host environment for server-side computation including objects representing requests,
    clients, and files; and mechanisms to lock and share data. By using browser-side and server-side scripting together, it is
    possible to distribute computation between the client and server while providing a customized user interface for a Web-based
    application.</p>

    <p>Each Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own host environment, completing the ECMAScript execution
    environment.</p>
